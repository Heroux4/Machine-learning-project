This is a Readme for my Machine Learning Final Project were I had to find a current problem with the education learning system and come up with a solution. In this you will see code for the 3 models that I made for each subject of the SAT scores were a model was made to try and predict scores from past years.
There is a presentation and audio that is included with also a paper talking about this problem as well.
